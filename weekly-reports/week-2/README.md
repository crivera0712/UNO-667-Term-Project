## Report Summary

For this weekâ€™s milestone, we focused on setting up the development environment for the backend of our project. Alongside this goal, we also decided to get a head start on the design of the database.

To aid in the database creation process, we used [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io). We drafted a rough sketch of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the one covered in class. In the upcoming week, we plan to review this rough draft and create a finalized version.
