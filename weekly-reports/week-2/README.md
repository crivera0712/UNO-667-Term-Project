	For this weekâ€™s milestone we wanted to set up our development environment for the backend for our project. Along with this goal we also decided to get a head start on the design of the database for our project. When creating our database we used dbdiagram.io. We came up with a rough sketch of the ERD based off the one that was covered in class. For the upcoming week we want to review this rough draft and create a finalized version. 
	Milestones that were assigned for this week were: 
    - Setup development environment
